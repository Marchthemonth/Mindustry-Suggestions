I've been playing Mindustry for over a year now, and v6 is very exciting. I'm entirely a PvE (campaign) player, just to share where my perspective is.
Although with the campaign, I greatly enjoy/tolerate the new shared resource mechanism, the campaign (so far) is way too easy. I just finished up Nuclear Complex, and it wasn't that difficult at all to do. Of course, being a v5 player, I knew to upgrade as much as I could before progressing. Even still, there was tremendous challenge about the successive and increasingly difficult waves. It made it a strategic choice when to launch.
Obviously, "launching" in the v5 sense is definitely gone and I'm open to how this new mechanism works, and generally for the new progression. But I'm incentivized to get through the waves then just acquire as much materials as possible. And to me, the worst part is that I have no fear of additional waves. It's way too easy and borderline boring that I have no threat.
Of course, I have a few other maps to get through, but it doesn't yet seem that there's a real threat on the horizon.
nothing to really challenge me with these new weapons or awesome units.
